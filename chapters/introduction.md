# Introduction

Computer Science is a skill which seems difficult. One might
think it requires extensive study and multiple degrees, whilst
this is certainly a benefit, Computer Science is simply a knowledge
of particular theory which can be learned by anyone.

Here we will go through the core concepts of Computer Science taught
throughout University. This will act as revision for myself having
not visited these concepts since completing my own degrees, and
to aid others in learning the concepts.

You may be wondering why you would want to learn this, for me,
it is more so for the habits it instills. Learning Computer Science
builds your problem solving skills, it helps you to be more methodical
and approach problems in a more structured and professional manner.
Learning key concepts such as Big O Notation and data structures gives
us a toolbox which we can access when we come across a difficult problem.
These concepts take time to understand, and can be difficult to remember
and retain as we don't often use these concepts working in development
but on the times when we do find ourselves needing them they are invaluable
assets in our toolkit.
